# PostgreSQL Database

In this lab you will be migrating data from a PostgreSQL relational database.

## Use a pre-configured database

If you are participating in an instructor-led lab, they may have already set up this database for you. Ask your instructor for the connection URI and credentials.

:::caution
In an intructor-led lab you will use the provisioned PostgreSQL database, no need to do anything else.

  ## 🦸 Option A: Load the schema and data into your own PostgreSQL server

  If you already have a PostgreSQL server set up, you can import the schema and data used in this lab. Download the file 
  [1-library-schema-and-data.sql](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/relational-migrator-lab/blob/main/docker/sample-postgres-library/init/1-library-schema-and-data.sql)
  and load it using [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/app-psql.html) or [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/).

  ## 🦸 Option B: Run a PostgreSQL container using Docker

  If you don't have an existing PostgreSQL server but have Docker installed, you can easily load a container pre-configured with 
  PostgreSQL and the sample database:

  1. Clone or download the code from this lab's [Github repo](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/relational-migrator-lab).
  2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the repo root.
  3. Build the Docker image by running the command: 
  ```sh
  docker build -f ./docker/sample-postgres-library/Dockerfile -t sample-postgres-library .
  ```
  4. Start the Docker container by running the command:
  ```
  docker run -p 5432:5432 sample-postgres-library
  ```
  The PostgreSQL server can be accessed at localhost:5432 with a username of `postgres` and a password of `postgres`.

  ## 🦸 Option C: Load a SQL file
  Choose this option if you just want a quick hands-on experience and you don't need to run an actual migration.
  Download the file [library-schema.sql](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/relational-migrator-lab/blob/main/resource/library-schema.sql)
  and upload this file to the Relational Migrator later, at the [create a project](/docs/category/-create-a-project) step. 

  This is just the schema of the database, without actual data, so, you will not be able to perform an actual migration since you do not have a source database. But you can model the schema and play around with the Relational Migrator.
