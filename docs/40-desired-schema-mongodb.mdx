# ðŸ“˜ Desired Schema in MongoDB

Since MongoDB is a document database, you have more flexibility in how you model your data. When migrating from
a relational database to MongoDB, it's important to consider how your data is accessed, and model the data such 
that __data that is frequently accessed together is stored together__ by using __embedded documents__ and __arrays__. 

The following screenshot shows the MongoDB schema we will be creating in this lab.

A few key points:
- Books will contain an array of authors with author id and name for fast retrieval. This is using the [Extended Reference pattern](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-the-extended-reference-pattern) to reference a separate collection (Authors) but having in books enough information about the author.
- Reviews are not included in the books collection as they can grow and become an [unbounded array](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/schema-design-anti-pattern-massive-arrays/), an antipattern in schema design.
- An author can have several aliases. We just store those strings in an array.
