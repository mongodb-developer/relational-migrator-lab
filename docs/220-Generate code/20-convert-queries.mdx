# 👐 Convert SQL queries

Relational Migrator can help convert SQL queries to MongoDB Query Language, wrapped 
in your choice of programming langauge. This feature uses Artifical Intelligence and requires an Atlas account and internet connectivity.

- At the top, switch to Code Generation tab
- Click Query Converter
- Sign into with your MongoDB Atlas account
- Accept the Query Converter licence terms
- Click `Paste SQL query`
- In the empty query, type `SELECT * FROM books WHERE "bookOfTheMonth" = true AND pages > 500` 
- Leave the language as JavaScript and click Convert. 

After a while, the equivalent MongoDB query will be shown at the right of the page.
