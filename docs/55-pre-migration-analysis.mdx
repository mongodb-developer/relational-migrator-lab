## Generate the report

We can generate a report of the schema we are about to migrate. This is useful to understand the structure of the data and how it will be represented in MongoDB.

- To do that, click on the `Pre-Migration Analysis` tab.
- Then click on `Run analysis`.

## Review the Summary

You'll see a summary of the analysis, which includes:
- The _Predicted migration readiness level_, that will give you a rough idea of how ready your schema is for migration.
- The number of tables, stored procedures, triggers and views in the relational schema.
- The size of the database.

## Review the Database

If you click in `Database`, you can see all detected risks in the `Impact analysis` tab. 

From there, you can review the Tables in detail, including number of rows, columns, types, etc.

You can also check the Stored procedures, Trriggers and Views and even review the SQL code.

## Migration Prerequisites

In the `Migration prerequisites` tab, you can the prerequisites for the migration. In this case, we see that `Postgres Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) logical replication must be enabled in Postgres before running a Continuous migration job.`
