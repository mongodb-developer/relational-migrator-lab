# ðŸ“˜ Schema in PostgreSQL

The following screenshot shows an entity-relationship diagram of the relational database we wish to migrate. This is a library management app that stores information about books (table `books`), where a book can have many authors (table `authors`) and an author can write many books (`author_book` link table). Users can leave reviews (`reviews` table). You can have many copies of the same book. Users borrow and return books (this is registered in the `operations` table). A library user can have many addresses (`user_addresses` table).
