# Edit mapping to authors collection (from from author_alias table)

We want to modify the MongoDB schema so that each author's aliases are represented as an array of strings. 

- On the MongoDB diagram view, click the `authors` collection
- On the relational mappings list on the right, click on the edit icon of `author_alias` embedded array mapping rule
- In the list of fields, uncheck `authorId`
- In the mapping rule's advanced settings, Check `create array of primitive values`
- Click `Save and close`
