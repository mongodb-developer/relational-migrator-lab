# 👐 Connect to the Database

## Add a new connection

We can store the credentials of our database so in the next session we can connect quickly. In this case, we'll create a new connection selecting "Add a new connection". 

## Select PostgreSQL as Database Type

Then we'll select PostgreSQL as our source database.

## Enter connection details

Enter the details for the PostgreSQL database you will be migrating from.

- It's important to click on the `SSL` tab and activate SSL (SSL mode Prefer is fine), otherwise we won't be able to connect to cloud hosted databases.
- If your instructors have configured a server for you to use, ask them for the host name, username and password. 
- Database name should be "library"
- Click `Test Connection` to ensure your details are correct.
- Click `Connect` to proceed to the next step.
- You can give your connection a name and a tag to make it simpler to remember later
