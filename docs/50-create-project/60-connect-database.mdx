# üëê Connect to the Database

## Add a new connection

We can store the credentials of our database so in the next session we can quickly re-connect. In this case, we'll create a new connection selecting "Add a new connection". 

## Select PostgreSQL as Database Type

Then we'll select PostgreSQL as our source database.

## Enter connection details

Enter the details for the PostgreSQL database you will be migrating from.

- It's important to click on the `SSL` tab and activate `Use SSL` (`SSL mode` Prefer is fine), otherwise we won't be able to connect to cloud hosted databases.
- If your instructors have configured a server for you to use, ask them for the host name, username and password. 
- Click back on the `General` tab and enter the database name as `library`.
- Check the `Save password` box if you want to save the password for future connections.
- Click `Test Connection` to ensure your details are correct. You should see a message saying "PostgreSQL database connection successful."
- Click `Connect` to proceed to the next step.
- You can give your connection a name and a tag to make it simpler to remember later.
