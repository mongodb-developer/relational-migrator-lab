# 👐 Creating a New Project

Ensure the Relational Migrator is installed and running (either in your codespace or locally at http://127.0.0.1:8278/).

## Create a New Project

<Tabs groupId="Create a New Project">
  <TabItem value="FirstTime" label="First Time using Relational Migrator">

    If you're running the Relational Migrator for the first time, you will see a welcome screen. We will `Start from scratch` and click on `Connect database`.

## Select one of the three options
- 👐 Click **Connect database** under "Connect to live database" if you are running the source database in the cloud, Docker or using your own hardware. This is what we will use during an instructor-led hands-on lab.
- 🦸‍♂️ Click **Import .SQL file** under "Load schema from a file" if you don't have access to a source database and just want to work with the schema (you won't have any data to import though).
- 🦸‍♂️ Click **Create sample** under "Use a sample schema" to play around with a test schema, without any data. This does not require connecting to a real DB. We won't use this one in this Lab.
