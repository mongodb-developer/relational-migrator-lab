## Select one of the three options
- 👐 Click **Connect database** under "Connect to live database" if you are running the source database in the cloud, Docker or using your own hardware. This is what we will use during an instructor-led hands-on lab.
- 🦸‍♂️ Click **Import .SQL file** under "Load schema from a file" if you don't have access to a source database and just want to work with the schema (you won't have any data to import though).
- 🦸‍♂️ Click **Create sample** under "Use a sample schema" to play around with a test schema, without any data. This does not require connecting to a real DB. We won't use this one in this Lab.
