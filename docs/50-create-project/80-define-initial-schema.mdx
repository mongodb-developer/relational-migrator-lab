# üëê Define the Initial Schema

Relational Migrator gives you three options on how your initial MongoDB schema will be created. Regardless of which option you choose, you can manually modify your schema later. 

| Option      | What it does     | 
| :------------- | :---------- | 
| Start with a MongoDB schema that matches your relational schema | Maps each table exactly to one collection, including link tables (for 1:n relationships). We're just replicating the existing schema, which won't take advantage of the Document Model.  | 
| Start with a recommended MongoDB schema   | Will try to understand your schema and embed 1:n relationships. | 
| Start with an empty MongoDB schema   | Your MongoDB schema will be empty. You'll create all the mappings yourself. | 

Select `Start with a recommended MongoDB schema`

You can see which tables will be mapped to a collection in MongoDB: those marked as `TOP-LEVEL`.

Select the following six collections as `TOP-LEVEL` since they are the main entities in our schema:

- authors
- books
- languages
- operations
- reviews
- users

Any tables you did not check will be embedded in other collections.

Select the casing you'd like for your collections - the default is camelCase.

Click `Next`, then give your project a name.
