# 👐 Add last three reviews to each book (from reviews table)

We want to modify the MongoDB schema so that each book contains an array of its latest three reviews.

:::info
This is an implementation of the [Subset Pattern](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-the-subset-pattern).
:::

In this step we will embed the book details into the empty array from the join table. 

- On the MongoDB diagram view, click the `books` collection.
- On the relational mappings list on the right, click `+ Add`.
- Select `Embedded array`.
- Select `reviews` as Source table.
- In the advanced settings, check `Add array conditions`.
- In `Sort by and order` option, select `timestamp` and toggle the order to descending.
- Set `Limit number of rows` to `3`.
- Uncheck the `bookId` and leave the rest of the fields checked.
- Click `Save and close`.

Limitations: 
- Continuous Migration Mode will not support this transformation
- You will not be able to enable Data Verification when you create the Migration Job.
