# üëê Change genres in books

We want to modify the MongoDB schema so that each book's genres are represented as an array of strings. We'll have data duplication, as genres will get copied on each book. This is a good strategy if the duplicated data does not change often.

We'll go from the proposed array of objects:

```json
bookGenres: [
    {
        "bookId": "Some Book Id",
        "genres": "fiction"
    },
    {
        "bookId": "Some Book Id",
        "genres": "novel"
    }
]
```

to an array of

```json
genres: [ 
    { "name": "fiction" }, 
    { "name": "novel" } 
]
```

- On the MongoDB diagram view, click the `books` collection.
- Click on the edit icon of `genres`. Deselect `id`, This is a child relationship of `bookGenres`, and we'll merge these fields into the parent, to avoid too much unneccesary nesting.
- Click `Save and close`.
- Click on the edit icon of the `book_genre` embedded array.
- Change the field name from `bookGenres` to `genres`.
- Uncheck `bookId` and `genreId`.
- Click `Save and close`.
