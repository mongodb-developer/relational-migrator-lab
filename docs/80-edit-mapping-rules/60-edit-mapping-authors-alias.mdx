# 👐 Edit author's aliases array

We want to modify the MongoDB schema so that each author's aliases are represented as an array of strings. 

- On the MongoDB diagram view, click on the `authors` collection.
- On the relational mappings list on the right, click on the edit icon of `author_alias` embedded array mapping rule.
- In the list of fields, uncheck `authorId`.
- In the mapping rule's advanced settings, Check `create array of primitive values`.
- Click `Save and close`.
