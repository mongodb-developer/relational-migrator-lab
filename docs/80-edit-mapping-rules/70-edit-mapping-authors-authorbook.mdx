# 🦸 Edit mapping to authors collection (from author_book table)

:::info
Extra activity! Do it if you have extra time or are following along at home. It won't be covered during the hands-on lab.
:::

We want to modify the authors collection to include an array of IDs representing their books. 

- On the MongoDB diagram view, click the `authors` collection
- On the relational mappings list on the right, click on the edit icon of `author_book`
- Edit the field name from `authorBooks` to just `books`
- In the list of fields, uncheck `authorId`, leaving `bookId` checked
- In the mapping rule's advanced settings, Check `create array of primitive values`
- Click `Save and close`
